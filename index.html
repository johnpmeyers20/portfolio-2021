          <h3>Design + Development</h3>
          <p>I've always enjoyed building things with my hands. Software Engineering gives me the same sense of accomplishment at a much more physically accessible level. I will help you design your site, or work with UX designers to make your dream site a reality.</p>

          <h3>E-commerce</h3>
          <p>I got into Web Development because in 2013, I launched my own webshop and failed. That experience gave me the motivation I needed to go back to school. Now, as a certified Software Engineer, I can help you and your business hit the ground running!</p>

      <h2 class="section__title section__title--about">Who I am</h2>
      <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--about">Designer & Developer based out of NYC</p>

      <div class="about-me__body">
        <p>Straight out of college, I landed an operations role handling travel expenses for Albemarle Corporation, where I fell in love with programming logic via Excel’s VBA. I leveraged my newfound knowledge to simplify our team’s workflow, and developed an automated dashboard for the global service center’s managing director. While teaching myself how to program in Excel, my attention was turned on to microcontrollers and the exciting phenomenon that was being generated by Arduino and RaspberryPi in the hobby sphere.</p>

        <p>I was so enamored by these products and the endless possibilities that they present users, that after much debate, I quit my job and decided to build a website. My intent was to teach children and curious adults coding fundamentals with YouTube videos by building simple robots that they could program themselves. Having had no formal training, and frankly no idea what it took to build a webshop at the time, my mission resulted in a short but very valuable learning experience. It also provided me with a segue into HR for the United Nations Refugee Agency.</p>
          
        <p>At UNHCR, I returned to Excel and developed a program that simplified the HR process for our entire section. Eventually it resulted in a much quicker response time to candidates, and thus a faster recruitment process. After moving back to the US in 2018, I started working at Guitar Center which I thought would allow me to teach myself programming on the side.</p>
          
        <p>With reflection on my previous entrepreneurial experience, and feeling frustrated with the amount of time it took to achieve my learning goals, I finally decided that my passion was worth investing in and went back to school. General Assembly brought my pace to lightning speed! I learned how to build full stack web apps and the logic, theory and practice behind programming in general. I find that software engineering is both humbling and empowering, but always fun.</p>
          
        <p>Aside from all that, my passions include:
          <ul class="about-me-list">
            <li>reading - I shoot for 40 books a year.</li>
            <li>music - I'm a singer/songwriter and play guitar every day</li>
            <li>travel - I love traveling and have had wild adventures in very distant places</li>
            <li>trekking - Over the past few years, my wife and I have
              <ul>
                <li>done back to back Caminos, walking from St. Jean Pied de Port, France, to Porto, Portugal (800 miles over 2 months)</li>
                <li>completed the Everest Base Camp trek in Nepal (altitude @ Kala Patthar 18,514 ft!)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
